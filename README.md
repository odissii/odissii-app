# odissii
odissii is a full-stack, mobile first web application that allows supervisors to track the feedback they give to their employees to improve supervisor-employee relationships. There are two types of users of odissii: supervisors (people who directly oversee regular employees) and managers (people who oversee supervisors). odissii allows supervisors to record feedback for the employees they supervise and see visual representation of their history of feedback over time. Managers can see how all of their supervisors are doing in providing feedback to their employees. The reports generated from this application help managers doing quarterly or annual reviews and most importantly, help supervisors reflect on and document the feedback they are providing to their employees.

## Getting Started
### Setup
1. Create a new database called odissii.
2. Use the database.sql file to create all of the tables you will need to run this project.
3. Start postgres if not running already by using ``brew services start postgresql``
4. ``npm install``
5. Create a .env file containing the following information:
   SERVER_SESSION_SECRET
    my_oauth_refresh_token
    my_gmail_username
    my_oauth_client_secret 
    my_oauth_client_id

    You will need to use the Goggle API Console to acquire the tokens needed.
6. You will need to sign up for accounts with the Cloudinary as well and replace the FeedbackFormView and AddEmployee
